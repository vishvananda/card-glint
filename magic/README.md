# Magic drawing pack

This optional pack translates a card's presentation fields into card-glint
recipes: frame and text rasters, art windows, etching sources, and editable
regions. Frame definitions live here so new frames and rendering fixes can be
reviewed in public pull requests. There is no engine, editor or host-app dependency.

**Fan-content and external-asset terms:** read [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).
This Magic game pack is unofficial Fan Content permitted under the Fan Content
Policy. Not approved/endorsed by Wizards. Portions of the materials referenced
are property of Wizards of the Coast. ©Wizards of the Coast LLC.

## Use the pack

```ts
import { createRenderer, type CardDocument } from 'card-glint';
import { magic, type MagicCard } from 'card-glint/magic';
import 'card-glint/magic/fonts.css';

const renderer = await createRenderer({ canvas });
const face: MagicCard = {
  name: 'Example Adept',
  typeLine: 'Creature — Human Wizard',
  colors: ['U'],
  manaSymbols: ['2', 'U'],
  rulesText: 'When this creature enters, draw a card.',
  power: '2',
  toughness: '2',
  illustration: '/my-original-art.webp',
  setCode: 'GLINT',
  rarity: 'uncommon',
  frameStyle: 'modern',
  borderColor: 'black',
};
const card: CardDocument = { id: 1, revision: 1, recipe: magic.describe(face, 'inspect') };
renderer.upsertCards([card]);
await renderer.ready(card.id, card.revision);
// Place it with updateScene() and render(), as in the core README.
```

For script-only inclusion, use `magic.js` and a stylesheet link to `magic.css`
beside `browser.js` in the browser release or version-pinned CDN tree.
The browser ZIP includes `magic.html`: serve the extracted directory over HTTP
and open that page to edit presentation JSON and inspect the resulting frame.
This optional page fetches external frame/font URLs; the default example does not.
The pack is a separate entry point: importing the core or original showcase
does not import Magic code or fonts. Font/frame URLs are pinned in
[assets.json](assets.json) and [fonts.css](fonts.css); illustrations come from
the caller. A `GLINT` set symbol is the default when no set is supplied.

`opticalDocument(id, revision, face, tone)` splits artwork from printing for
art-only rain, heat and pool treatments. `tone` selects gold, silver or prismatic
reflection on the sharp printed layer. `mtg` remains an alias for `magic`.

Geometry is normally normalized `[x, y, width, height]` with a top-left origin.
Typography uses the 488 × 680 reference face. Tier `inspect` paints at 732 × 1020;
`table` paints at 244 × 340. Some layouts override rectangles and wrapping.
These are TypeScript definitions, not a complete declarative frame schema.

## Contribute a frame or fix

1. Identify the selection rule, geometry and painting owners above. Keep game
   semantics here; do not add Magic branches to the Rust or browser core.
2. Add or update a pinned external asset reference, with attribution here. Do
   not commit third-party frame/font/image binaries or official card scans.
3. Update geometry, art windows and hit regions together. Include a new cache
   key component whenever visible content or a rendering option is added.
4. Add a focused case to the Magic pack tests. Check both raster tiers, art-only
   effects, editable bounds and affected special frames. Use original artwork
   or synthetic fixtures in checked-in evidence.
5. Run `npm run check`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:package`, `npm run test:magic`, and the focused
   browser checks. For a visual change, show before/after images in the PR and
   identify the browser; Safari and Chromium do not always rasterize alike.

The library owns caching and graphics resources. Painting happens during recipe
preparation; pointer movement and finish changes should reuse prepared assets.
The original showcase remains independent of this optional pack and its assets.

## Existing scene or DOM editor

Use `card-glint/magic/presentation` for the shared geometry and raster painter.
The [host integration contract](../../docs/host-integration.md) documents image
leases, custom set symbols, cached masks and shader integration without creating
another graphics context.
